# File_Encryption_WinForms
A Win Forms version of my File_Encryption project. 

This program uses your Microsoft Windows user account to encrypt your files so that they are inaccessible by 
other users on the same computer, or network. 

WARING - If you use this program to encrypt your files, please be sure you decrypt them before moving them to 
a new computer, or be sure to export your Windows security certificate to your new computer.
